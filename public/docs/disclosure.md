The Diluv team has a great appreciation for security researchers and encourages them to contact us directly to share security vulnerabilities identified in our products and services. We ask that you act in good faith and follow our responsible disclosure policy to protect our user base and everyone else involved.

## Acting in good faith

1. Be respectful to our current operations. Avoid violating user privacy, interrupting or degrading services, and the destruction of data.
2. Do not access or modify data you should not have access to. 
3. Do not manipulate financial services or generate fraudulent transactions.
4. If personal or private information is encountered please stop all activity and contact us immediately.
5. Do not use vulnerabilities in a way which violates applicable law. 

## Disclosure Process

Thank you in advance for notifying us about a potential security issue. The best way to notify us of security issues is to send an email to security@diluv.com. You may also send us a private message [@DiluvSupport](https://twitter.com/DiluvSupport). When submitting your report please include as much relevant information as possible. Proposed solutions to security issues are also welcome. We may send a follow up message and request further information about your report as well.

## Public Disclosure

We believe that public disclosure is an important part of keeping companies and platforms accountable for the security of their users. We request that you hold off on public disclosure until we have reviewed your report, implemented a solution, and verified that the issue has been resolved.

## Rewards

Diluv is an open source platform that is not financially backed by any organizations. We have dedicated all financial resources to operational costs and paying royalties to content creators on our platform. While we can not offer financial compensation we may offer public recognition. In some cases we may also offer "swag". We also allow for public disclosure after the vulnerability has been resolved, which you may use in your blog posts, videos, and presentations.

## Legal Action

We promise not to pursue legal action or file a complaint to law enforcement against any security researcher operating in good faith. However Diluv reserves all legal rights in cases where the responsible disclosure policy has not been complied with.

## Scope
