# Diluv Privacy Policy

This privacy policy applies to diluv.com and any other service operated by Diluv which links to this policy. We reserve the right to revise, amend, or modify this policy at any time and in any manner. This policy was last updated on 07-06-2020.

## Contact

If you have any questions or concerns about the Privacy Policy you may email us at support@diluv.com. You may also reach out to us on our public [Discord](https://discord.diluv.com) server or our [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/DiluvSupport).

## Personal Data

Diluv collects some Personal Data from users. We will only collect Personal Data when it is necessary for a feature or service to be provided.

### Personal Data Types

This section categorizes the different types of Personal Data Diluv collects. For specific information on what Personal Data Diluv collects please refer to the [Detailed Information on Personal Data]() section.

#### Requested Personal Data

Diluv will request Personal Data from users when it is necessary for a service to be provided. For example, it is not possible to create a Diluv user account without providing us your email address. The types of Personal Data we may request include usernames, email addresses, password hashes, unique user IDs, billing information, service usage, and cookies.

#### Processed Personal Data

In some cases, Diluv will process your Personal Data to derive additional information. Some derived information such as Password Hashes will be associated with your unique user ID. Additionally, Diluv may process your Personal Data to create anonymized aggregate data. One example of anonymized aggregate data would be calculating how many downloads a specific file has. Another example would be calculating how many new users Diluv has gained in a month. Anonymized aggregate data will not be linked to any specific user.

#### 3rd Party Data

Diluv integrates many 3rd party services. These 3rd party services may collect additional Personal Data and are subject to their own privacy policies. You can learn more about how 3rd party data works by checking out the [Detailed Information on Personal Data]() section.

### Retention Time

Diluv will only retain Personal Data for the duration of time necessary for relevant services to be provided unless a longer retention period is required. Some reasons for an additional retention time may include:

-   Complying with legal or regulatory requirements
-   Preventing fraud or abuse.
-   Financial record-keeping.

### Data Protection

All sensitive Personal Data such as passwords and billing address will be encrypted using SSL when they are sent to our servers. Once received our servers will decrypt the data and store it in a secure format. For example, passwords will be hashed and salted and addresses will be encrypted.

### Children's Privacy

Diluv does not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13. Children under the age of 13 are prohibited from using our services. If you learn that a child has provided us with personal information in violation of this policy you can alert us at abuse@diluv.com.

### Sell & Transfer

Personal data collected by Diluv is not sold or transfered to 3rd parties. In some cases we may share anonymized aggregate data which can not be tied to an individual user such as total unique download for a specific file. 3rd party services may collect their own data. 3rd party services are not controlled by Diluv and are subject to their own privacy policies. See our "Detailed Information on Personal Data" section for more info.

### Detailed Information on Personal Data

#### Diluv Accounts

Diluv accounts are an optional service offered by Diluv. Creating an account allows you to create your own project pages and distribute your content through our platform. To create a Diluv account you are required to provide an email address, a username, and a password. When a Diluv account is created we will create a unique user ID. This ID will be associated with your email address, username, and a salted hash of a password. Additionally, we will store a timestamp of when the account was created. The email address, username, and password will be used to verify your identity when logging in to your Diluv account. The unique user ID will be used to associate content with your account. The join date will be displayed publicly on your profile page.

#### Service Emails

Diluv may send users service emails. These are emails related to services we are providing such as account confirmation or support replies. Service emails are an inherent part of the Diluv Accounts service and can only be opted out of by deleting your Diluv account.
