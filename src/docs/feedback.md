# Feedback
The Diluv team is very eager to recieve feedback from the community, especially while the project is in development. You can use the following methods to submit your feedback to our team.

## GitHub
The best way to proivde feedback is through our GitHub page. Posting an issue on GitHub will notify our team and allow community members to contribute to the discussion. Going through GitHub will also help us keep track of your feedback so it doesn't get lost. Keep in mind that GitHub is a public platform and you should never post personal info or account info on there.

When using GitHub please use one of the issue templates. These templates help us understand your feedback and streamline a lot of the feedback process. If you're unsure about something in the template please try your best to provide that information.

Do **NOT** use Discord to directly message team members or community members about your feedback unless you have been explicitly invited to do so.
